# Requirements



# Lead
- Syslog has a controllable format argument that can be used for a printf attack!
- Write a pointer to the stack using a pointer to the stack, and then write to that address.



# Ideas
- Use deflate & inflate to copy data around memory, either using the original vtable, or by overwriting the vtable.
- Writing to minremain or something similiar a pointer so that it'll be leaked as a "minutes remaining" message.
- Use sscanf for infoleak.



# Unclear



# Notes
- The other member that is being overwritten at spawnstate is events' buf.



# History
- Change the size of alen "legitimately" in order to get a different bin and see what memory lays there.
- Parse all vtables in the executable (didn't work because cannot partially overwrite pointer to point to a different vtable)
