# Requirements



# Lead
- Push or pop an 8-byte sized value to the stack using a gadget into strlen, and then call system with strcmp.



# Ideas
- Overwriting lastsaytext and saychars to avoid spam detection.



# Unclear



# Notes
- The other member that is being overwritten at spawnstate is events' buf.



# History
- Change the size of alen "legitimately" in order to get a different bin and see what memory lays there.
- Parse all vtables in the executable (didn't work because cannot partially overwrite pointer to point to a different vtable)
