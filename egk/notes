# Requirements



# Lead
- Overwrite the got entry of strcmp / strlen to system.



# Ideas



# Unclear



# Notes
- The other member that is being overwritten at spawnstate is events' buf.



# History
- Change the size of alen "legitimately" in order to get a different bin and see what memory lays there.
- Parse all vtables in the executable (didn't work because cannot partially overwrite pointer to point to a different vtable)
