# Lead
- Push or pop an 8-byte sized value to the stack using a gadget into strlen, and then call system with strcmp.



# Ideas
- Overwriting lastsaytext and saychars to avoid spam detection, or connect as another client.
- Change the vtable to an only ret gadget.



# Notes
- The other member that is being overwritten at spawnstate is events' buf.
