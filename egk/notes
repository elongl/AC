# Requirements



# Lead
- Pivot the stack into the heap, change system's command towards messages, call system.



# Ideas



# Desperate
- Try to exploit the heap overflow not as the first client.



# Unclear



# Notes
- The other member that is being overwritten at spawnstate is events' buf.



# History
- Change the size of alen "legitimately" in order to get a different bin and see what memory lays there.
- Parse all vtables in the executable (didn't work because cannot partially overwrite pointer to point to a different vtable)
