# Lead
- Overwrite members + vtable of demorecord.
- Make isprint or isspace return true by overwriting their GOT.
- See what's on the stack when invoking sscanf.



# Ideas
- Try to exploit the heap overflow not as the first client.
- Overwriting the NULL terminator of name on client for infoleak purposes.



# Notes
- The other member that is being overwritten at spawnstate is events' buf.



# History
- Change the size of alen "legitimately" in order to get a different bin and see what memory lays there.
- Parse all vtables in the executable (didn't work because cannot partially overwrite pointer to point to a different vtable)
